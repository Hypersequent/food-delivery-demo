# Food Delivery Demo App for QA Sphere

This repository contains a Food Delivery demo app, a project forked from [wowthemesnet/template-fooddelivery-bootstrap-html](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/template-fooddelivery-bootstrap-html) and rewritten in SvelteKit for QA Sphere.

## Original Template Dependencies

The original template used the following main dependencies:

- Bootstrap 4.4.1
- AOS 2.3.1
- Sass 1.22.9

## Rewritten Version

The rewritten version of this demo app utilizes SvelteKit, offering a more modern approach to building the application while still maintaining the core functionalities of the original template.

## Installation

To get started with this demo app, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hypersequent/food-delivery-demo.git
cd food-delivery-demo
npm install
```

## Running the App

To run the app in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the SvelteKit development server, making the app accessible via `localhost` on your browser.
